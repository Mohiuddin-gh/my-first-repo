            <h2><U>About Food</U></h2>

            <p>Taste is not what you think. Every schoolchild learns that it is one of the five senses, a partner of
                smell and sight and touch, a consequence of food flitting over taste buds that send important
                signals—sweet or bitter, nutrient or poison?—to the brain. Were it so simple.
                In the past decade our understanding of taste and flavor has exploded with revelations of the myriad and
                complex ways that food messes with our consciousness—and of all the ways that our biases filter the
                taste experience. Deliciousness is both ingrained and learned, both personal and universal. It is a
                product of all five senses (hearing included) interacting in unexpected ways, those sensory signals
                subject to gross revision by that clump of nerve tissue we call the brain.

            <p><b>K</b>orean food is one of the most popular cuisines worldwide. It ranked 4th in a study about the most
                popular international cuisines on Instagram.
                Korean offer something that foodies have begun craving for: an experience. It’s not only about the food
                you’re fed: the experience itself is just as important. And perhaps the huge success of the film
                Parasite helped turned the world’s attention to South Korea and everything it has to offer.
                The four distinct seasons of Korea mean a variety of seasonal foods using local ingredients at their
                best in spring, fall, and winter.

                In spring, Koreans enjoy seasonal spring greens not seen throughout the long winter. In the hot summer,
                they cool down with cold food or replenish their energy with high protein ingredients. During the
                harvest season, there is a great variety of foods and in the cold winter, high nutrition fermented foods
                are enjoyed and prepared for long storage.

            <h1>Mongolian</h1>
            <p><b>M</b>ongolian cuisine is influenced by the region’s continental climate, as well as Russian and
                Chinese
                cultures to an extent. This nomadic cuisine’s staple diet consists primarily of meat and dairy, with
                minimal use of vegetables.
                Horse, yak, beef, lamb, and even camel are all delicacies in Mongolia. If you are looking for a flavor
                burst with spices, you will only get salt and onion.
